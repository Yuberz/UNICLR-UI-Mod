# UNICLR-UI-Mod
This is a mod for UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes that replaces a good chunk of the UI elements with ones from UNICLR.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release.
2. If you have any conflicting mods (makes changes to oMtaqooqotvvonnpwmq) then uninstall them or you will have to manually hex edit/make the mod compatible.
3. Extract all the files to the root of the UNI2 folder (grpdat folder should be next to uni2.exe).

## Current Progress
- Added Lifebars
- Bigger EXS numbers added
- Vorpal Flash added
- Meter "textures"
- Small EXS numbers
- The weird "underline" under the names/portrait
- Random UI Text (point, Clause #, time, etc.)
- Deleted EXS label next to meter (It's incompatible without more extensive modding)
- Character Portraits
- Character name font

## To Do
- Combo Meter (Not sure how feasible this is at my skill level)
- Round Start (Same reason as Combo Meter)

## Will Not Implement
- Making the meter color blue at 100 EXS (it's really helpfuly to visually be yellow, I made a custom texture just so it could be yellow. If you're truly a purist you can easily edit the files yourself).
- Changing the GRD meter (It's such a minor change that it's nearly pointless to do)
- Move characters under the life bar (requires extensive modding)
- Move the round counts (same reason as above)
